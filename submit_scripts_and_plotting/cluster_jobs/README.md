# Cluster Jobs

These are the scripts that run all of the trials for the analysis. They are organized as follows:

### `steady`
Scripts to run trials (background, bias tests, sensitivity) for time integrated followups

### `transient`
Scripts to run trials (background, bias tests, sensitivity) for short timescale followups

### `luminosity_constraints`
Scripts to run trials for using FIRESONG to simulate populations of neutrinos sources and compare to the performance of this analysis

Running any of the scripts as is, when on one of the submit nodes, will submit the relevant jobs to the cluster.
